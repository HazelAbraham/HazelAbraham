Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights and building intelligent AI-driven solutions.

## 🎯 About Me

I'm a **Data & Analytics professional** with **2+ years of experience** in turning complex data into simple, real-time insights that drive business decisions. I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering** (2021) and a **PGP in Data Science and Engineering** from Great Learning.

Currently, I'm working as an **Associate Data Scientist at Nalco Water** (An Ecolab Company), where I specialize in:
- Building interactive dashboards and automations with Power BI and Python
- Designing and optimizing SQL models for data extraction and transformation
- Creating solutions that help teams make smarter decisions with clarity

**What drives me:** The challenge of turning scattered, raw information into meaningful stories that lead to real impact. I've witnessed firsthand how the right dashboard or automation can completely transform how teams think and operate.

## 🚀 Current Focus

I'm stepping deeper into the world of **Generative AI** and **Agentic Systems**, exploring:
- 🦜 **RAG Pipelines** - Building retrieval-augmented generation systems
- 🔗 **LangChain & LangGraph** - Creating intelligent workflows and multi-agent frameworks
- 🤖 **Agentic AI** - Developing autonomous systems that understand and reason with data
- 💡 **Gen AI Applications** - Leveraging foundation models for enterprise solutions

**Vision:** Create intelligent analytics solutions that merge human insight with AI precision—systems that don't just visualize data but understand and reason with it.
